## Description

Tutorial to test the code.

## Installation

```bash
# paste this in your terminal
$ git clone git@github.com:RaulAquino207/java-topics-for-web.git
```

## Importing the project

With eclipse pre installed click on "file" and go to the "import" option, choose the "existing mavem projects" option, a popup will appear on your screen and in the field root directory click on "browser" and choose the project and click "finish".

## Database
Once again, taking into account that the Mysql database is already installed, just create a database with the name of "jpa" and that's it, run the application, the persistence.xml file is already configured.

## Running the code

Basically what you should do now is open src/main/java and look for the package called br.com.lesson.project.code and right click and "run as - run on server".
